This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# JavaScript Method Explorer

An interactive learning tool designed to help developers understand JavaScript methods and their practical applications. This project emerged from my journey learning JavaScript while in the Appreticeship Program with Creating Coding Careers, particularly coming from a semi-programming background but had never used JavaScript.

## Project Purpose

This tool helps bridge the gap between different programming paradigms by providing:
- Real-time visualization of JavaScript method effects
- Interactive examples that demonstrate how methods work
- Clear explanations of when and why to use specific methods
- The ability to chain multiple methods to understand complex operations

## Features in Development

The tool will allow users to:
1. Input their own test data (strings, arrays, or objects)
2. Select from various JavaScript methods applicable to their data type
3. See immediate results of method application
4. Understand method behavior through detailed explanations and examples
5. Experiment with method chaining to learn how methods can work together

## Technical Implementation

Built using:
- Next.js for the framework
- React for the user interface
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Modern JavaScript features for demonstrations

## Development Journey

This project serves as a practical learning experience, documenting my progression from VBA to JavaScript while creating something useful for others on a similar journey.

## Future Plans

- Add more method categories and examples
- Include common use-case scenarios
- Implement visual representations of data transformations
- Add interactive tutorials and challenges

*This project is actively under development as part of my learning journey in JavaScript and React.*

## Development Setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
